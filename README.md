# credit_use_case

This contains uses-cases for two chapters in the forthcoming ML text from Gopal, Philps and Weyde. 
The use case notebooks are companions to the full text in the chapters, so are cut down in nature and only intended to demonstrate the steps described in detail in the book itself. These are also still in draft!

Note for the Ch20 use-case, this is designed to be conducted in GoogleColab and needs to contain 2 install cells to support the libraries on that platform
